# Tietokannat (Databases)

This folder contains assignments from the **Tietokannat (Databases)** course I completed at JAMK University of Applied Sciences Open University in 2024.  

The exercises cover the basics of relational databases and SQL, including:
- Creating and modifying database structures (DDL)
- Querying and updating data (DML)
- Joins, subqueries, and constraints
- Database design and ER (Entityâ€“Relationship) modeling

Tools used: **MySQL** and **MySQL Workbench**
